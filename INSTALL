The current build procedure is based on ant. You can build
the code by
	cd java-augeas
	ant build
	
Type in ant -projecthelp to see all the tasks you can execute
with the build script.

You will need a Java Development Kit accepting the version 1.6
of the language since the bindings use enums as well as the new 
for loop syntax

You can select the Java Development Kit by using the JAVA_HOME 
environment variable. This can be useful if you have multiple 
JDK installed or if it is installed in a non standard path.

Please report any compatibility problem to the augeas
mailing list at:
